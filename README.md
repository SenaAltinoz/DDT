We killing strangers
So we don't kill the ones that we love
     And we got guns, we got guns
:)

Beauty hurts!
The value of life is only understood when you give it away.
Happiness is hidden in the moment before I fire my gun!
All the pieces must fall into place, they will dance, they will sing, they will DIE!



I'm a flower blooming in the swamp, I am the beauty itself!
